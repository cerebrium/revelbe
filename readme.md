# Javascript

We've got you started with Sequelize & sqlite but feel free to swap it out for something else if you are more comfortable with another tool.

## Getting it started

- Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
- Add fixtures to `sqlite-database/setup.js`
- Init database with `yarn setup-db` or `npm setup-db`
- Run the express server with `npm start` or `npm start`
